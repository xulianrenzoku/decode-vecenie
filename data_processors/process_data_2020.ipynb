       "{'STRENGTHS': 'His feel for the game is just absolutely off the charts. Has a case for having the highest basketball IQ in this draft class. Makes the right decision all the time. Keeps the offense in flow. That starts as a ballhandler. Haliburton is an extremely high-level passer out of all situations. Great with head-man passes in transition. Sees everything and plays unselfishly. The game is not about his numbers despite the fact that he put up great numbers this year. Despite not exactly being a high-level pick-and-roll scorer, he can make every pass in the book as a pick-and-roll passer. He reads the defense exceptionally well. Takes advantage of exactly what heâ€™s presented and has an incredible internal process for finding the right decision. His poise is remarkable for a guy who played both of his seasons essentially as a teenager. Thereâ€™s a real patience and calm to everything he does. Defenses canâ€™t really speed him up and his size for the position makes it tougher to defend him with lead guards. Very fluid in the way he changes paces. At 6-foot-5 with a 6-foot-7 wingspan, has elite size to see over the top of defenders and make plays when guarded by a true lead.  Shoots it exceedingly well off the catch. Has tremendous touch on his jumper. Hit 49.3 percent of his catch-and-shoot jumpers this year, with all of the makes being 3s. That gave him a pretty outrageous 73.9 effective field goal percentage on such shots. According to Synergy, that was the sixth-best mark among the 623 players nationally to take at least three such shots per game. Within the top-100, only Aaron Nesmith was better. Has a bit of a strange release. Itâ€™s a push shot that comes from out in front of his face with a low release point. However, he makes up for those awkward mechanics by having exceptional range on it. Already confident from well beyond NBA range. If he gets even a small amount of space to fire, he can knock it down. This should allow him to translate exceedingly well playing next to a star on-ball wing who takes up a lot of offensive possessions. Also really excels as a passer and playmaker out of advantage situations where he can pump fake and get into the teeth of the defense after attacking a closeout. In general, if you get Haliburton downhill either out on the break or in an advantage spot, heâ€™s going to be tough to deal with. If he beats his first defender, he also has a really nice little developing floater game. Made 45 percent of those shots this season. Does a great job shielding the ball from defenders then using his length to extend and release.  Also, a high-level defender in a team concept. Largely just a 1-2 defender right now because of his lack of strength but knows exactly where he needs to be, rotationally, at all times. Has his arms consistently outstretched looking for deflections, which allows him to play longer than he actually is. Reads what the ballhandler wants to do and does a great job harassing and disrupting with his length on ball. A bit of a gambler but tends to get there when he gambles. Has a good sense of when to take those chances.  ',\n",
       " 'WEAKNESSES': 'Iâ€™m not convinced Haliburton has enough ability to consistently separate as a lead ballhandler at the next level. Great footwork and changes pace well but lacks a degree of burst and shake. Doesnâ€™t seem to be wildly comfortable with his left hand. Much better athlete if he receives the ball in an advantage situation where heâ€™s either able to take advantage of defenders already on the move, or when heâ€™s already on the move himself. Great passer who sees everything, but consistently leaves his feet prior to passing, which could lead to further turnovers in the NBA because you automatically put a clock on yourself when you leave your feet. Also doesnâ€™t really get to the rim all that often. Only 1.5 attempts at the rim in the half court per game this season according to Synergy. Made those shots when he got there with touch, but just doesnâ€™t have the explosiveness to consistently get there right now. The good news is that the in-between game he has with the floater helps to make up for it, but he has to be able to get into the second level to take advantage of it.  Additionally, there is a concern about whether or not heâ€™ll be a threat off of pull-ups at the next level. While he has great touch and shot well from 3, his mechanics arenâ€™t suited to him being a high-volume pull-up threat. Itâ€™s tough for him to get shots off when heâ€™s taking them off the bounce. Not really a late-shot-clock threat. Low release and long load time allow defenders to really contest him. Only made 28.1 percent of his pull-up jumpers this year according to Synergy, at a 34.2 effective field goal percentage. The two factors above contribute to real worries that he might not actually be a lead guard, but rather more of a secondary half court playmaker who can help you push tempo and make great reads in transition. Thatâ€™s less valuable than a lead guard, but the fact that he has size and his game translates to playing off ball definitely gives him a higher floor than most lead guards.  Finally, his on-ball defense in general leaves something to be desired despite his ability to play disruptively with his hands. Can get driven a bit easier by quicker guards than youâ€™d like to see. Can get leveraged by smaller guards who can get under his high center of gravity. Also has issues with his strength. In general, that might be his biggest concern. How much stronger can he get? Can he keep putting on enough strength to defend multiple positions? Will he be pushed around by stronger players on the ball as an offensive threat? As he gets stronger, will he add a bit of explosiveness?  ',\n",
       " 'SUMMARY': 'Haliburton is going to be a useful NBA player because few guys who think the game at the level that he does while maintaining the ball skills he does at 6foot-5 fail. Heâ€™s an elite passer, has tremendous touch and can play on the defensive side of the floor. Personally, I see him more as a combo guard who plays off the ball in the half court more than I see him as a lead. Thatâ€™s okay with me, though. Imagine him playing the role of someone like Lonzo Ball with better touch and less strength. Ball isnâ€™t quite a half court lead guard that you can trust to make plays on his own, but put him out there with Jrue Holiday as a half court shot creator and he becomes an incredibly effective, high-level role player. Haliburton will help create a ton of transition opportunities, will contribute to positive defenses and likely will hit shots off the catch. Thatâ€™s a hell of a floor for a prospect. If his strength ever comes along and he keeps developing that left hand and change of direction handle while morphing into a lead guard? He has a real shot to become a top-half of the league point guard. Even if that doesnâ€™t happen though â€” and I think itâ€™s probably a long shot that it does â€” Haliburton is the kind of player that I absolutely want on my team if my goal is to win basketball games. Heâ€™s smart, heâ€™s a great teammate and he plays the game the right way while putting all of his teammates in better positions to succeed.   ',\n",

       "{'STRENGTHS': 'Everything starts with Ballâ€™s elite-level feel for the game. He sees and understands the game in a way that few teenagers do. That displays itself most in his passing ability. Ball is tremendous at reading the second and third levels of the defense and making anticipatory passing reads based off how those defenders play in help. He sees nearly every pass that is available, and on top of it has the talent to execute said passes from a wide variety of angles. Heâ€™s an elite-level live-dribble passer. He can throw one-handed whip passes from either hand. His ability to hit the cross-corner kickout will translate well given how available that pass tends to be in the NBA. He can hit pocket bounce passes to rollers and weights lobs perfectly. Additionally, despite a relatively wild style of play, Ball tends to relatively limit turnovers because of that basketball IQ and the way that he can control the ball.  Indeed, Ball is a tremendous ballhandler who can create at an extremely high level. He can change tempos and paces without getting flustered. He plays with much better bend than Lonzo, allowing him to more easily break down defenses. His poise in ball-screens is tremendous, as he can wait for the help to develop while keeping the ball away from defenders. Heâ€™s tremendous at using his body, despite a lack of strength, to keep defenders on his back or hip in order to put pressure on the defense in the paint. On top of that poise, Ball also has a wicked, quick crossover and the ability to get low and create separation. He has very fluid hips, which allow him to open up and quickly blow-by with speed with a degree of deception. Heâ€™s not an elite athlete, but this mix of poise, patience, change of tempo and change of direction allows him to really get separation whenever he wants as an attacker, with or without ball-screens. He gets into the lane and forces defenders into tough situations more than any other player in this class, allowing him to score despite still working through his efficiency.  At 6-foot-6, Ball has elite size for the lead guard position. On top of that, Ball is also a great rebounder for a guard and his elite level IQ does showcase itself at times on defense. He makes good reads and rotations when engaged and can shoot passing lanes for turnovers and transition opportunities. There is upside for him to be a defensive playmaker, even though he was ineffectual there this season. ',\n",
       " 'WEAKNESSES': 'The defense isnâ€™t a sure thing, though, because Ball doesnâ€™t quite engage at a high enough level on that end. Having never been held accountable defensively prior to this season, Ball faced an adjustment and he didnâ€™t always meet the challenge. Sometimes heâ€™d get caught wiping his feet while he was supposed to be tagging a roller on the back side. Sometimes, heâ€™d hunt rebounds to start the break and ball-watch instead of staying in solid position. His overall intensity and mindset must improve on that end.  The big issue on offense is a question of his jump shot. Ball hit just 25 percent from 3 this season, although there is reason to believe he is a better shooter than that. Really, the low percentage comes down to shot selection above all. There are times that heâ€™ll pull up with 20 seconds left on the shot clock for a contested 30-footer for no good reason. And overall, his jumper does have some mechanical work that needs done, starting with his footwork and base off the catch. However, he can hit shots coming off of screens if defenders go under on him. Heâ€™s also grown about seven inches in the last two years, which has led to an elongation of his frame and body. Heâ€™s skinnier and the trajectory on his jumper has changed. As he gets more comfortable with his frame and gets stronger, he should become a more consistent shooter, more capable of repeating his mechanics. ',\n",
       " 'SUMMARY': 'Ball should enter the NBA as one of the most creative passers in the league from Day 1. He should be able to make plays at a high level early because of his basketball IQ, his live dribble passing and his experience playing up in competition level from a young and age professional experience in the NBL, which is a stronger, more physical league than the NCAA. His ability to be an elite-level distributor and creator who can get separation from defenders and break down defenses at this age gives him a higher upside than anyone in the class. Whether or not he meets that upside will be dependent on how the defense and the shot develop over the next three years. If Ball is willing to put in work and become a 34 to 36 percent 3-point shooter â€” something I absolutely donâ€™t think is out of the question if heâ€™s more willing to take better shots and excise the awful shot selection he exhibits at times â€” he will become an All-Star caliber offensive player. And if heâ€™s willing to showcase more engagement on the defensive end in the NBA, he has the tools to reach a positive level on that side of the floor, too. Think of the upside here as a bigger prime Rajon Rondo, a player I think was on a Hall of Fame trajectory prior to injuries and the downside as being a low-level starting point guard who never totally comes through with enough efficiency.
