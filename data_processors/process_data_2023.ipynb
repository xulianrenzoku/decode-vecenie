       "{'BACKGROUND': 'Parents are Tricia and Andre Sr. Both of his parents played basketball in college at the community college level. Has two younger siblings. Played at Albany Academy and was wildly successful. Has essentially always been a winner and played winning basketball. Jackson led his school to three straight state title games in New York from 2017 to 2019, winning in 2017 and 2019. Was considered a borderline three-star/four-star recruit until the summer before his senior season, where he played with City Rocks AAU team on the Nike EYBL circuit and played exceedingly well at Peach Jam. That blew him up into a genuinely high-end recruit. His senior season tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but his team was again ranked as the  No. 1 team in the state in his classification. He was a do-it-all wing who averaged 18 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and three steals in his senior season while shooting an absurd 68 percent from the field. Was named his classification’s player of the year in the state in 2020. Ultimately finished his collegiate career as a top-50 player in the country and a solid four-star recruit, per recruiting services. Committed to Connecticut in the fall of his senior season after Dan Hurley made him the top priority following his hire. Chose UConn over Iowa, UCLA and Syracuse. Was a bench player early in his freshman season but broke his left wrist in December and ended up missing nearly two months of action. Immediately entered the starting lineup as a sophomore, though. Emerged into an important piece as a sophomore, becoming a defensive stopper and well-rounded ball mover for the Huskies. But became more than that as a junior. Emerged into a critical piece as team co-captain along with Adama Sanogo. Was one of the clear leaders on the team and is noted as a high character player. Was an essential player on a team that went on to win the NCAA National Championship in one of the most dominant Tournament runs in history, winning every game by at least 13 points. Jackson declared for the 2023 NBA Draft after this past season while maintaining his eligibility. Was invited to the 2023 NBA Draft Combine.',\n",
       " 'STRENGTHS': 'Jackson has a great frame for an NBA wing at nearly 6-foot-6 without shoes with a 6-foot-9 3/4 wingspan. One of the best athletes in the 2023 NBA Draft class and will enter the NBA as a top-5 percent athlete in a league full of ridiculous ones. Has everything teams look for from that perspective. He is remarkably explosive vertically, has tremendous body control and strong hang time. Monster dunker. On the ground, he has a good first step and elite lateral quickness. Great hip flexibility and shiftiness. On top of it, he never seems to tire. He’s able to go 100 percent for full games with ridiculous aerobic capacity. It allows him to play with an unbelievable motor that never stops running. He never stops moving on either end of the court and is the epitome of a positive energy giver for his team. Constantly tries to get on the ground for loose balls. Attempts to recover everything. Leads in that way by example for everyone else. Has elite feel for the game. One of those guys who just knows where to be all the time and knows how to make winning plays. That can’t be emphasized enough. Best role comes on defense where he can be a genuine plus. Connecticut used him as a stopper on a wide variety of players this past season. Guarded scoring guards, point-of-attack players, and true wings all effectively. It’s hard to beat him one-on-one because of how quick he is, how long he is, and how disciplined his fundamentals are. Has very fluid hips and is light on his feet, which allows him to be very reactive to stepbacks and tough moves from ballhandlers. Moves his feet incredibly smoothly. Fights through screens well. Gets skinny to get over the top of them. Takes good, tight angles around them both on and off ball. Stays attached and locked onto his man’s hip. In one-on-one settings, strong through his core and chest, allowing him to wall up against opposing ballhandlers as they drive while also keeping his hands high, contesting everything.  Absorbs contact super well while also being able to stay in front. Great verticality principles. Jackson also is a terrific team defender. Closeouts are elite because of how much ground he can cover and how light he is on his feet. Allows him to contest shots at a high level and then also drop his hips to recover onto drives. And then, if he or any of his teammates get beat, has ridiculous recovery tools because of his length and leaping to get scramble and get back into the play. Impactful for a wing rotating from the weak side. Knows how to use his athleticism in a monster way. Has some spike blocks at times. But more than that, because his vertical leap is so high, he’s impactful when using verticality and getting his arms up into the play. On offense, his best skill is his ability to move without the ball and pass. He’s an unbelievable cutter. He has a great sense of timing and great spatial awareness, understanding exactly how to space the floor for his teammates despite his lack of shooting. Baseline cuts for lobs and dump-offs. 45 cuts and downhill sprints off post-ups to use his leaping ability to attack the rim. Team used him in the dunker spot as well. Also understands what his teammates need as a mover without the basketball. If he sees the defense has two on the ball above the break, he’ll flash to the foul line extended area to give an outlet option. He vacates areas to open driving lanes. Also an excellent screener. Loves the drop off pass into a screen for his man to give him some space. Extremely sharp. If he receives the ball, he processes the game at an exceptionally high level. Quick decision-maker and playmaker. Knows how to keep advantageous situations and maintain advantages. Part of the reason for that is he can do everything at full speed. Sprints out on the break and just flings and sprays that thing out to shooters everywhere. Great hit-ahead passer early in transition. Excellent passer in the flow of the offense. Knows where his teammates are before he receives the ball and seems to also have a great understanding of how defenses will rotate around him after he catches it. Seems almost automatic with how quick he is as a decision-maker. Super-fast reversals that allow his team to keep the marginal advantage they already have. Also a good pick-and-roll passer and playmaker both as a handler and as a screener. Think he’s sharp at finding his roll man quickly out of screens. Teams often tried to blitz him because of his handle, and he reacted quickly. If they didn’t, it’s clear he’s out there manipulating defenses as he’s covering ground, reading the low man and attacking. Throws live-dribble, one-handed passes with ease from both sides. Hits cross-corner kickouts, has great touch on his lobs. Averaged 4.7 assists versus only two turnovers, which is absurd given his usage rate.As a scorer right now, he’s best out in transition where he can use his athletic tools to their fullest potential. Can grab-and-go off the glass and handle the ball, allowing him to attack the rim with ferocity. Because he is so fast, he can zoom past guys down the court with his long strides and explosive steps. If you don’t get a body in front of him, he’s throwing down. Also has this same incredible leaping ability as a cutter. Had 30 dunks this past season. Overall, made 67.1 percent of his shots at the rim, including 70.7 percent in half court. ',\n",
       " 'WEAKNESSES': 'The weakness here is simple and direct: It’s going to be difficult for Jackson to score in the half court in the NBA. Averaged just 9.2 points per 40 minutes in college, which is a historically low number for an upper-class wing who is considered draftable. Jackson is a poor shooter right now. He’s inconsistent, and the mechanics aren’t great. Made just 15 of his 59 catch-and-shoot 3s this past season, good for 25.4 percent, per Synergy. Doesn’t look comfortable or clean with his jumper. Everything here is a total rewrite and needs to be fixed from the ground up. His shot prep is poor because, when he catches, he seems to rarely be in a comfortable shooting position. Never his first option. Inconsistent shooting base where his feet look to be too narrow at times. Really takes him a second to load up into it. Loads up with his right arm flared out beyond the side of his body, then kind of catapults the ball up. Takes him a minute to find a comfortable spot for his hands on the ball. Tries to get himself into rhythm, but there just isn’t much there. Kind of a low release point where the ball is in front of his face. Ends up being a very flat trajectory. On the plus side, there’s not much to keep here, which means a shooting coach can go to town on it without worrying about taking anything away. On the downside, there is so much work to be done that it’s a multi-year fix, and it’s hard to truly buy it ever being a weapon.Jackson also doesn’t have any game off the bounce as a scorer in the half court. Given his jumper, he can’t be a pull-up threat. Even if he could, I don’t really think his handle is quite functional enough at this point to be able to get into stepbacks consistently. Comfortable handling the ball, but not exactly a guy who can break you down in isolation. Has no in-between  game as a jump shooter. Doesn’t even take or make midrange jumpers. Did try to implement a little floater to middling success. Can get into it from a variety of ways, including jump stops and off one foot. But the ball comes out of his hand flat. Made just  36 percent of these shots. Don’t think this is an effective counter at this point, but it’s at least a developmental skill that can  be improved. All this leads to a simple question: What do you do with him on offense to get the most out of the positive skills? As a ballhandler, because of the lack of shooting and scoring ability, teams just started going under his screens. As a floor spacer and off-ball player, teams just stopped closing out on him entirely, which gummed up the works on offense. If you put him in the dunker spot, you can hide a big on him there for help at the rim. Even when he’s spacing beyond the 3-point line, you can do that anyway. You need to be creative and find different ways to use him. Will probably lead to fewer teams being interested in him because of it. ',\n",
       " 'SUMMARY': 'I love Jackson. He was one of my two favorite players in college basketball last season because it’s clear he thinks the game at an exceptional level. His ability to play at high speed and process everything that’s happening around him is not normal. His reactivity and quick decision-making are superb. His movement without the ball is terrific. He’s an elite athlete with terrific, functional traits that will impact the game at an extremely high level because he also plays with a never-ending motor. He’ll defend across the positional spectrum and will provide terrific team defense. But in today’s NBA, you must be able to do something on offense to score. Otherwise, teams will leave you alone, and there will be poor impacts on your team. And yet, Connecticut still scored 124.3 points per 100 possessions when Jackson was on the court versus 114.3 when he was off it, per Pivot Analysis, because of the way he’s able to move without the ball, push tempo and make plays for his teammates. So, where does that leave us? At the end of the day, I’m just willing to bet on Jackson. I think he and a smart coaching staff figure out how to use his elite basketball IQ and athleticism to their advantage. It’s also heartening that a lot of the best teams in the league have players like this on their roster and utilize real offensive movement to make them effective. Think about the Warriors with Gary Payton II or Denver with Bruce Brown. Brown’s level of impact is probably unattainable unless Jackson improves drastically in terms of his shot, but Payton is doable. Jackson is a similarly elite athlete to Payton – not a small feat – and is similarly a genius- level processor of the game at speed. Not every team is going to be interested in Jackson. It’s going to take someone creative. But if you’re willing to put in the work, Jackson can be an impactful non-shooter.  '}"
